"S2A","Confirmation Message Shows Incorrect USD Amount After Converting 500 EUR","Medium","Medium","App: Currency Converter (Android, v1.2.3); Device: Pixel_6a_API_34 emulator (Android 14.0); Date: March 22, 2025","User balance: 1000 EUR, 0 USD; Exchange rate: 1 EUR = 1.129 USD (as per the test in S1, where 100 EUR converts to 112.90 USD)","1. Open the app and go to the currency converter page. 2. Verify initial balance: 1000 EUR, 0 USD. 3. Sell 500 EUR (enter '500' in the amount input field). 4. Submit the conversion and wait for the confirmation message. 5. Check the confirmation message displayed.","Confirmation message: 'You have converted 500.00 EUR to 564.50 USD. Commission Fee - 0.00 EUR.' (500 EUR * 1.129 = 564.50 USD)","Confirmation message: 'You have converted 500.00 EUR to 564.51 USD. Commission Fee - 0.00 EUR.' The USD amount is off by 0.01 (564.51 instead of 564.50).","The balance updates correctly to '500 EUR' and '564.5 USD', indicating that the conversion itself is correct, and the issue is only in the confirmation message. This discrepancy might be due to a rounding error in the UI display logic for the confirmation message. The test script (Scenario S2, line 62 in android.feature) failed due to this mismatch."
